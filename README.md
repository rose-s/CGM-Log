Currently, CMG Log displays text messages on a website using Twilio's API and Meteor.

The project is in its intial stages. Later versions are intended for parents of kids with type 1 diabetes. The log will show a trend graph of their child's glucose levels and allow them to make annotations to that graph using Twilio text messaging.
