CMG Log currently displays text messages on a website using Twilio's API and Meteor.

Later versions will be intended for parents of kids with type 1 diabetes. CMG Log will show a trend graph of their child's glucose levels and allow parents' to make annotations to that graph using Twilio text messaging.
